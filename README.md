# Birbs

A [boids](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html) implementation in Rust for WebAssembly.

## Why?

Well i'm learning Rust and the boids simulation facinates me.

## TODO

* It uses a quadtree to make looking up neighbours really quick but this results in undesirable clustering.
* Give the boids some form and make their direction clear (at the moment they're just 2x2px squares)
* Add some obstacles

# Getting it running

At the time of development you'd need a nightly build of Rust (I was on 1.31.0 â€” if you find the project is no longer working on later version let me know!).

You'll also need [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/):

```bash
wasm-pack build

```

This will generate an npm compatible package in the `/pkg` directory

# Demo

The project comes with a demo to try things out.

From the root of the project you can run

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

This will build a minimal demo (found in `index.js` and serve it up over a local web server

**Tests**

I'm still new to Rust but there are a few tests

```bash
cargo test
```

# Demo

It's not hosted anywhere currently but here is a gif with 5000 particles ðŸ˜‰
